Handling Exception

1. Type of exceptions
	- Checked exception : The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions
	- Unchecked exception : The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions
	- Error: Error is irrecoverable
	
2. Keyword
	- try
	- catch
	- finally
	- throw
	- throws
	
3. Try block

	try
	{    
		//code that may throw an exception    
	}
	catch(Exception_class_Name ref){}    
	
	try
	{    
		//code that may throw an exception    
	}
	finally{}  

4. Multiple catch block
	- At a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is executed.
	- All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for ArithmeticException must come before catch for Exception.
	
5. Nested try 
	- In Java, using a try block inside another try block is permitted. It is called as nested try block.
	  Every statement that we enter a statement in try block, context of that exception is pushed onto the stack.
	  
6. Finally block
	- Java finally block is a block used to execute important code such as closing the connection, etc.
	
7. Throw keyword
	- The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
	- We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. The Exception has some message with it that provides the error description. These exceptions may be related to user inputs, server, etc.
	- We can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions in Java by throw keyword. It is mainly used to throw a custom exception. We will discuss custom exceptions later in this section.

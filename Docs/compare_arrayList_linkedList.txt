ArrayList vs LinkedList

ArrayList

1. ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
2. Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array
3. An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
4. ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
5. The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.
6. When an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.
7. an ArrayList is a resizable array.

LinkedList
1. LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
2. Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list
3. LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4. LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
5. The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
6. An empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.
7. LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.
